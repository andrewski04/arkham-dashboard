This is the prototype for the Project Arkham security dashboard. It has both a frontend dashboard, and a backend API to serve dummy data.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository to a location of your choice

2. Open VSCode and use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required packages

3. If prompted to create a virtual environment, create one and select `requirements.txt` as the dependencies.

4. If using a venv, run the server with `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe run.py`. Otherwise, use `py run.py`.
